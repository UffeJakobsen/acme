         ...the ACME Crossassembler for Multiple Environments

                         --- the  library ---


The files in the "ACME_Lib" directory tree can be accessed from
within ACME sources when using the pseudo opcodes "!source" or
"!binary":

If the file names are given using "..." quoting, ACME will look for
the files in the current directory.
If the file names are given using <...> quoting, ACME will look for
them in the library directory.

The actual location of the library directory can be given in several
different ways:
    1. a default can be given when compiling the ACME binary.
    2. an environment variable called "ACME" overrides this.
    3. and the CLI switch "--libpath" overrides even that.

Setting up an environment variable is OS-specific, so for example on
Linux, put this in your .bashrc file:
    export ACME="$HOME/.acme/ACME_Lib"
...and of course you will then have to copy the library tree to that
location.

All files in the ACME_Lib directory tree are in the public domain.
They are *NOT* covered by the GNU General Public License, under which
the actual ACME program is released.
