; previous versions of ACME complained about the second block's condition not
; being defined. but obviously the first block's condition was added to solve
; exactly this problem, so ACME should not generate an error in this case.

; now, as soon as one block has been executed, the conditions of all following
; blocks are ignored just like the blocks themselves.
