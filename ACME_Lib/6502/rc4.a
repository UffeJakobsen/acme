;ACME 0.97

; this is an implementation of the stream cipher algorithm known as RC4.

; you need to define these symbols in your code:
;	rc4_length	a single byte to hold key/chunk lengths
;	rc4_count	a single byte (tmp var for iteration counter)
;	rc4_ii		a single byte to hold state
;	rc4_jj		a single byte to hold state
;	rc4_state	a full page of memory (256 bytes)
;	rc4_key		key buffer
;	rc4_in		input buffer
;	rc4_out		output buffer
; the size of the buffers limits how much data you can pass to the functions.
; all three buffer addresses may be identical, in that case the output will
; overwrite the input (and/or the key).
; functions you can then call:
;	rc4_init	initialise state
;	rc4_usekey_X	use key (in key buffer, length in X) to change state
;	rc4_reset	reset ii and jj (call between keying and processing)
;	rc4_process_X	de/encrypt a chunk of data buffer-to-buffer (length in X)
